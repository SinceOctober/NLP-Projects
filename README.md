NLP Implementation Projects

## Emotion Recognition in Tweets using Recurrent Neural Networks
In this project, you will create a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and train it on a tweet emotion dataset to recognize emotions expressed in tweets. The dataset contains thousands of tweets, each labeled with one of six emotions. This is a multi-class classification problem in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain, and we'll be using TensorFlow as our machine learning framework.


## Create a Superhero Name Generator with TensorFlow  
In this guided project, you will create a neural network that generates unique superhero names by learning patterns from a dataset of over 9,000 names. The dataset includes superheroes, supervillains, and other fictional characters from various comic books, TV shows, and movies. This project focuses on **text generation**, a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP).  

You will develop a **character-level language model** capable of predicting the next character in a sequence. By providing the model with a seed input—either a single character or a sequence—it generates the next character, which is appended to the seed. This process repeats, allowing the model to generate a complete, creative superhero name.
