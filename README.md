NLP Implementation Projects

## Emotion Recognition in Tweets using Recurrent Neural Networks
In this project, you will create a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and train it on a tweet emotion dataset to recognize emotions expressed in tweets. The dataset contains thousands of tweets, each labeled with one of six emotions. This is a multi-class classification problem in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain, and we'll be using TensorFlow as our machine learning framework.


## Create a Superhero Name Generator with TensorFlow  
In this guided project, you will create a neural network that generates unique superhero names by learning patterns from a dataset of over 9,000 names. The dataset includes superheroes, supervillains, and other fictional characters from various comic books, TV shows, and movies. This project focuses on **text generation**, a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP).  

You will develop a **character-level language model** capable of predicting the next character in a sequence. By providing the model with a seed input—either a single character or a sequence—it generates the next character, which is appended to the seed. This process repeats, allowing the model to generate a complete, creative superhero name.  

## Transfer Learning for NLP with TensorFlow Hub

This hands-on, project-based course will take approximately 1.5 hours to complete. Throughout the course, you will learn how to apply transfer learning to natural language processing (NLP) tasks using TensorFlow Hub, and build models that can tackle real-world text data problems.

In this course, we will focus on three key learning objectives:  

- Use pre-trained NLP text embedding models from **TensorFlow Hub**.  
- Perform **transfer learning** to fine-tune models on real-world text data.  
- Visualize **model performance metrics** using TensorBoard.
