## Emotion Recognition in Tweets using Recurrent Neural Networks
In this project, you will create a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and train it on a tweet emotion dataset to recognize emotions expressed in tweets. The dataset contains thousands of tweets, each labeled with one of six emotions. This is a multi-class classification problem in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain, and we'll be using TensorFlow as our machine learning framework.
