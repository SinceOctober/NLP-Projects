# Emotion Recognition in Tweets using Recurrent Neural Networks  

In this project, you will create a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and train it on a tweet emotion dataset to recognize emotions expressed in tweets. The dataset contains thousands of tweets, each labeled with one of six emotions. This is a multi-class classification problem in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain, and we'll be using TensorFlow as our machine learning framework.  

### Who Is This Project For?  

This hands-on, guided project is designed for learners with prior programming experience in Python and a theoretical understanding of Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, and optimization algorithms such as gradient descent. It is ideal for those who want to move beyond theory and start building practical NLP solutions using TensorFlow. Basic familiarity with TensorFlow is recommended.  

### What Will You Learn?  

Over the course of this 2-hour project, you will:  

- Build a Recurrent Neural Network architecture using TensorFlow.  
- Train the model on a labeled tweet emotion dataset.  
- Perform text classification to predict emotions in tweets.  

### Learning Objectives  

By the end of this project, you will be able to:  

- Use a Tokenizer in TensorFlow to process text data.  
- Apply padding and truncation to create uniform sequence lengths.  
- Build and train a Recurrent Neural Network for text classification.  
- Leverage NLP and deep learning techniques for emotion detection in tweets.  

This project provides a structured, practical introduction to implementing text classification models and prepares you to tackle similar tasks in the NLP domain.
