# Create a Superhero Name Generator with TensorFlow  

In this guided project, you will create a neural network that generates unique superhero names by learning patterns from a dataset of over 9,000 names. The dataset includes superheroes, supervillains, and other fictional characters from various comic books, TV shows, and movies. This project focuses on **text generation**, a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP).  

You will develop a **character-level language model** capable of predicting the next character in a sequence. By providing the model with a seed input—either a single character or a sequence—it generates the next character, which is appended to the seed. This process repeats, allowing the model to generate a complete, creative superhero name.  

### Who Is This Project For?  

This hands-on project is ideal for learners with prior programming experience in Python and a basic understanding of TensorFlow. It's particularly suited for those who have theoretical knowledge of Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, and optimization algorithms like gradient descent, and want to apply this knowledge in a practical setting.  

### Learning Objectives  

By the end of this project, you will:  

- Perform **Natural Language Generation** using TensorFlow.  
- Create and use a **tokenizer** to process character-level sequences.  
- Build and train a neural network to generate text.  
- Explore practical applications of NLP for creative tasks like name generation.  

This project provides a fun and engaging way to practice text generation while expanding your understanding of NLP and TensorFlow. By the end, you'll have a working superhero name generator and the skills to tackle similar text generation tasks.
