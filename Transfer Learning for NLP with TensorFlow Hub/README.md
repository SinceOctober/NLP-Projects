# Transfer Learning for NLP with TensorFlow Hub

Welcome to **Transfer Learning for NLP with TensorFlow Hub**! This hands-on, project-based course will take approximately 1.5 hours to complete. Throughout the course, you will learn how to apply transfer learning to natural language processing (NLP) tasks using TensorFlow Hub, and build models that can tackle real-world text data problems.

### Course Objectives  

In this course, we will focus on three key learning objectives:  

- Use pre-trained NLP text embedding models from **TensorFlow Hub**.  
- Perform **transfer learning** to fine-tune models on real-world text data.  
- Visualize **model performance metrics** using TensorBoard.  

This is a practical, hands-on project where you will learn how to leverage TensorFlow and TF Hub to perform text classification tasks. By the end of the project, you will be able to use pre-trained models, fine-tune them for specific NLP tasks, and visualize performance with TensorBoard.

### Prerequisites  

To get the most out of this course, you should have:  

- Competence in the **Python programming language**.  
- Familiarity with **deep learning for NLP**.  
- Experience with training models using **TensorFlow** or the **Keras API**.  

Note: This course works best for learners based in the North America region. We are working on extending support to other regions soon.

### Course Structure  

The course is divided into three parts:  

1. **Course Overview**: This introductory material that sets the stage for the course.  
2. **Transfer Learning for NLP with TensorFlow Hub**: The main hands-on project where we apply transfer learning to text classification.  
3. **Graded Quiz**: The final assignment to assess your understanding and successfully complete the course.

### Project Structure  

The hands-on project is divided into the following tasks:  

- **Task 1**: Introduction to the Project
